in a grid view as it updates live as images are analyzes it works properly but as image count is 3 in a grid it doesnt show third image, as soon as fourth is added it works again fine.

make all images in a grid scale fir to grid so quadratic but without changing proportions, crop then.

add options to analyze schema to apply zoom like 1.5x or 2x to images where it fits and quality allows for it.

make single images scale to full page with no borders.

add crop options to analyze schema especially when row or col layout choosen or when composition is not good
or trash or too much empty space etc.

nice to have:

allow for easy editing like croping images in kayout preview via drag sliders at each edge of image.

ability to add in title pages, pages with text only based on analysis feed into llm of what images are in the album at prev and next pages. like a list of pages and only images with their description and tags as this is enough context to decide for titles.

- maybe use google nana-banana image editing to lay titles like city names into images

converitng image meta coordinates to places for better metadata

maybe:

in case in memory?! if even so usaed storage gets an issue use gcloud buckets
